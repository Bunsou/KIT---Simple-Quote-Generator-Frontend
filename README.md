# Simple Quote Generator

#### Created by Taing Bunsou

## What it is?

This is just a simple quote generator that generates random quotes from a predefined list of quotes. The goal of this is just to make a simple project to practice my full stack development skills to integrate frontend, backend and database.

Tech Stack:

- Frontend: NextJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Shadcn UI
- Backend: NestJS, TypeScript
- Database: Neon (PostgreSQL), Drizzle ORM

## How to run it?

First go to my [backend repo](https://github.com/Bunsou/KIT---Simple-Quote-Generator-Backend.git) and follow the instructions there to set up the backend.

Once the backend is running, you can start the frontend by following these steps:

1. Clone the frontend repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bunsou/KIT---Simple-Quote-Generator-Frontend.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   cd KIT---Simple-Quote-Generator-Frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app
